# password-decrypter
The password verification script is a Python tool designed to verify whether a given plaintext password matches a known hashed password when hashed using the same algorithm and salt. While technically not decrypting the hashed password, it compares the hashed version of the provided plaintext password with the known hashed password to determine if they match.
